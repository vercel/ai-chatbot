## Usage in AgentOS

When you call the **devin-builder** agent via AgentOS:

```typescript
const task: AgentTask = {
  id: 'build_doc_analysis',
  origin: 'tiqology-spa',
  targetAgents: ['devin-builder'],
  domain: 'dev-ops',
  kind: 'build',
  priority: 'high',
  payload: {
    description: 'Build document upload and AI analysis feature',
    requirements: [
      'File upload with drag-and-drop',
      'Support PDF, DOCX, TXT',
      'Ghost API integration for analysis',
      'Display scores and summaries',
      'Upload history tracking',
      'PDF export functionality'
    ],
    context: 'Legal document analysis for custody cases',
    targetRepo: 'TiQology-spa',
    priority: 'high'
  }
};

const result = await routeAgentTask(task);
const taskMarkdown = result.result.data.taskTemplate;
```

The agent returns the formatted markdown, ready for human review and execution.

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Requirements should be clear and measurable
2. **Provide Context**: Explain why this work is needed
3. **Set Realistic Priorities**: Don't make everything HIGH priority
4. **Include Acceptance Criteria**: Define "done" clearly
5. **Link to Resources**: Include relevant docs, designs, or examples
6. **Break Down Large Tasks**: Keep tasks focused and achievable
7. **Tag Dependencies**: Note if this task depends on other work

## Integration with GitHub

Generated tasks can be:

1. **Created as GitHub Issues**: Paste markdown directly into issue
2. **Added to Project Boards**: Track in project management tools
3. **Referenced in PRs**: Link PR to original task for traceability
4. **Archived for Planning**: Save for sprint/iteration planning
