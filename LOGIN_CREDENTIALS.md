## 🎯 IMPORTANT NOTES

### **Development Mode:**
The app is currently configured to allow **ANY email and password** for testing purposes.

This means users can:
- Type any email (e.g., `anything@example.com`)
- Type any password (e.g., `password123`)
- Click "Sign in" and it will work!

### **Why This Works:**
The demo credentials message says: *"Use any email and password to try it out!"*

This is perfect for development and showing the revolutionary features without requiring real user registration.
