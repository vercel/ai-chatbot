# Current EXPLAIN Results

This directory is used by the automation to store the latest EXPLAIN JSON outputs for each query. These are compared to the baselines in ../ for regression detection.

- Do not commit these files unless updating baselines.
- Used by compare_baselines.js and the GitHub Actions workflow.
