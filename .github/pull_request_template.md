## Baseline Update Checklist

- [ ] I have reviewed the performance regression report and confirmed all changes are expected.
- [ ] Baseline JSONs in `ci/explains/` have been updated only for queries with intentional improvements.
- [ ] No unexplained regressions are present in the report.
- [ ] All new/updated baselines have been manually reviewed and approved.
- [ ] Artifacts from the latest CI run have been inspected as needed.

_Use this checklist when updating or accepting new performance baselines. Only update baselines after confirming changes are intentional and reviewed._
