## Tips for Natural Conversations

1. **Mirror their language**: If they say "customers," use "customers" not "clients"
2. **Industry relevance**: Always relate benefits to their specific industry
3. **Build progressively**: Start with basics, add complexity as they show interest
4. **Use questions**: Engage them with relevant questions to understand needs
5. **Positive framing**: Focus on opportunities, not what they're missing
6. **Social proof**: Mention "many small businesses" or "business owners like you"
