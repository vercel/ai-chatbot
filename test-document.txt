This is a test document for the AI chatbot file upload feature.

The document contains information about the implementation of a robust file upload system with:

1. Support for multiple file types (PDF, TXT, DOC, DOCX, CSV, JSON, MD, images)
2. AI-powered content parsing and extraction
3. Automatic context integration for chat conversations
4. Clean and minimalistic user interface
5. Proper error handling and user feedback

The system is designed to handle files up to 5MB and provides instant parsing upon upload.
Files are stored in Vercel Blob storage and parsed content is saved in the database for quick retrieval.

This implementation follows best practices for file handling and provides a seamless user experience.
