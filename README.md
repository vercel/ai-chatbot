## Model Providers

This template uses a custom OpenAI-compatible provider named `@HypO` (configured in `lib/ai/providers.ts` via `createOpenAICompatible`). Models are defined in `lib/ai/models.ts`. Included models: HyperMax, HyperMix, and HyperLite (default).

### Authentication

Set the provider base URL and API key in your `.env` file:

- `AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` — OpenAI-compatible base URL (e.g. `https://example.com/v1`)
- `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` — bearer token for the provider

With the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction), you can also switch to other providers like [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/chatbot)

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:migrate # Setup database or apply latest database changes
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
