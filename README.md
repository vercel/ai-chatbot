## Model Providers

This application uses [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/openai-service) to access AI models directly through the Azure platform. The default configuration includes GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini models.

### Azure OpenAI Authentication

To use Azure OpenAI, you need to:

1. Create an Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure portal
2. Deploy the necessary models (GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini)
3. Set up environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

```
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-azure-openai-api-key
```

For detailed setup instructions, see [AZURE_SETUP.md](./AZURE_SETUP.md).

With the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction), you can also switch to other LLM providers like [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-ai-chatbot)

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
